User management plays a vital role in Kubera by controlling the resources being accessed by a user to perform his/her role and the actions they perform. The purpose of this component is to be able to manage the users having access to the Kubera dashboard.
<br><br>
You can perform User Management by clicking on the <b>Settings</b> tab from the Kubera dashboard. Once you are inside the <b>User Management</b> screen, you can create users, manage them, and reset their password and username when required. Select the User for which you need to make changes, click on the <b>Edit Profile</b> tab
